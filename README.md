## Introduction
This is the implementation of ["Everything as a Code"](https://hackernoon.com/everything-as-code-explained-0ibg32a3) paradigm.
The desired state is to be able to build a Jenkins instance where all of its infrastructure, plugins, credentials, jobs, and many other things are versioned and stored in Git.

## System Requirements
This setup was built to support development on a Mac OS environment. 

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/Kostua/Vault)
- [Traefik](https://github.com/Kostua/traefik-docker)

## Configuration
Export necessary variables:

```
export VAULT_APPROLE='role_id'
export VAULT_APPROLE_SECRET='secret_id' 
```
[see this repo for deatail](https://github.com/Kostua/Vault)

## How To Use

```
git clone https://github.com/Kostua/Jenkins.git
cd Jenkins/
docker-compose up -d
```

## How its work

There are five files that will be used in this example:

* Dockerfile - the definition of the Docker image 
* docker-compose.yml - a file that helps us get all the Docker stuff up and running
* plugins.txt - the plugins that will be pre-installed in Jenkins
* jenkins.yaml - the definition of Jenkins with predefined job repository

Dockerfile - the definition of the Docker image 
It defines which version of Jenkins that be used and it pre-installs some plugins and additional packages.

docker-compose.yml - This creates a docker image from the Docker file and run Jenkins with network infra and connect all pice together.

plugins.txt - It contains a list of plugins and versions that should be installed before Jenkins is started.

jenkins.yaml - this is the place where Jenkins Configuration as Code (a.k.a. JCasC) Plugin comes into play. It lets us define the global and plugin configurations through a YAML file. Itâ€™s great because it handles the configuration changes and we can deploy an initial Jenkins install with all the configurations already applied.

And this part is full predefined jobs from a repository and run all of them:
```
jobs:
  - script: >
      freeStyleJob('JobsGenerator') {
        triggers {
                    hudsonStartupTrigger {
                      quietPeriod("60")
                      runOnChoice("ON_CONNECT")
                      label("")
                      nodeParameterName("")
                }
          }
        scm {
            github('Kostua/jenkins_as_code_jobs', 'master')
        }
        steps {
            dsl {
              external('*.groovy')
            }
        }
      }
  - script: >
      queue('JobsGenerator')
```

Project is: _in progress_
